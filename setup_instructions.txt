To set up the welcome message to appear every time you start a new Zsh session:

1)
Copy zsh_welcome.sh to ~/.local/bin/

2)
Run the following command:

echo "~/.local/bin/zsh_welcome.sh" >> ~/.zshrc

This will add the script to your .zshrc file so it runs automatically when you start a new terminal session.
